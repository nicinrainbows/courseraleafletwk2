## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(leaflet)

m_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()   
m_map <- m_map %>% addMarkers(lat= 1.2816, lng= 103.8636, popup="Gardens by the Bay")
m_map  
```
